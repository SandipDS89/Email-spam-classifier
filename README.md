## Project Structure
Email spam.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and model development.

README.md: Description and instructions for the project.

app.py: Streamlit web application to interact with the model and classify input email text.

model.pkl: Pre-trained model serialized using pickle.

requirements.txt: Python dependencies for running the project.

spam.csv: Dataset containing labeled emails for training and testing.

vectorizer.pkl: Serialized vectorizer for text preprocessing.

## Features
### Spam Classifier:
- Trained on a dataset of emails labeled as spam or non-spam.
- Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
- Provides high accuracy in identifying spam emails.

### Web Interface:
- Built with Streamlit.
- Allows users to input email text and classify it as spam or non-spam.
- Displays the predicted class and confidence score.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Git installed on your system

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Email-Spam-Classifier.git
   cd Email-Spam-Classifier
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open the app in your browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).

## Example Usage
1. Input email text into the provided field in the web app.
2. Click the "Classify" button to determine whether the email is spam or non-spam.
3. View the predicted class and confidence score.

### Example Output
#### Streamlit Interface
#### Sample Prediction
- **Input Email**: "Congratulations! You've won a prize. Click here to claim."
- **Predicted Class**: Spam
- **Confidence Score**: 92.34%
